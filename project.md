# System Reliability Drift Detection

A comprehensive system for detecting, analyzing, and responding to reliability drift patterns in system logs across multiple computing environments.

## Project Overview

This project implements an advanced log analysis pipeline that identifies reliability drift patterns in system logs, enabling early detection of system behavior changes and potential issues. The system processes and analyzes logs from diverse sources (HDFS, Apache, HealthApp, BGL, HPC, Linux, and Mac) using sophisticated pattern recognition and statistical analysis to detect when system behavior deviates from established baselines. The system focuses on efficient log processing and analysis to provide immediate insights into system behavior.

## Problem Statement

Modern distributed systems generate massive volumes of logs across different components, making it challenging to detect subtle system behavior changes that might indicate impending issues. These behavioral changes, termed "reliability drift," can manifest through various patterns:

- Gradual degradation of system performance
- Unexpected changes in component interaction patterns
- Variations in error rates and types
- Shifts in resource utilization patterns
- Changes in system response times
- Alterations in component communication patterns

If undetected, these patterns can lead to system instability, cascading failures, and service outages. Our analysis spans multiple log types to provide comprehensive system health monitoring and early warning capabilities.
