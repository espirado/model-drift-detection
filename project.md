# Model Drift Detection in Streaming AI Systems

A real-time system for detecting and responding to model drift in streaming data environments.

## Project Overview

This project implements a data mining pipeline that identifies distribution shifts in streaming feature data, enabling early detection of model performance degradation. It leverages Kafka as the streaming backbone and applies statistical methods to detect when incoming data patterns differ significantly from reference distributions.

## Problem Statement

Machine learning models deployed in production environments often experience degraded performance over time due to changes in the underlying data distributions - a phenomenon known as "model drift." This drift can occur gradually or suddenly, and if left undetected, can lead to incorrect predictions, poor decision-making, and system failures.

### Key Challenges

- **Real-time Detection**: Identifying distribution shifts as they occur
- **Noise vs. Drift**: Distinguishing between normal fluctuations and meaningful drift
- **Diverse Data Types**: Handling both numerical and categorical features
- **Resource Efficiency**: Performing complex analyses without excessive overhead
- **Actionable Insights**: Providing clear, timely alerts with appropriate severity levels

## Solution Approach

### Technical Implementation

The system performs the following key functions:

1. Ingests streaming data using Apache Kafka as the messaging backbone
2. Analyzes feature distributions across sliding time windows
3. Computes statistical distance metrics (Jensen-Shannon divergence, mean shift)
4. Applies adaptive thresholds to detect significant drift
5. Triggers alerts when drift exceeds acceptable levels
6. Visualizes drift patterns through an interactive dashboard

### System Architecture

The architecture follows a modular design with separate components:

- **Data Ingestion Layer**: Kafka topics for raw data streaming
- **Preprocessing Module**: Handles data cleaning and normalization
- **Feature Analysis Engine**: Computes statistical metrics on feature distributions
- **Drift Detection Service**: Applies algorithms to identify distribution shifts
- **Alert Management System**: Routes notifications based on severity
- **Visualization Dashboard**: Displays real-time metrics and distribution changes

### Data Mining Approach

The system employs several data mining techniques:

- **Streaming Data Processing**: Sliding window analysis of incoming data
- **Statistical Feature Extraction**: Computation of distribution moments and metrics
- **Comparative Analysis**: Measuring differences against reference distributions
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying statistically significant shifts
- **Pattern Recognition**: Classifying drift by type and severity

## SRE and Distributed Systems Relevance

This project addresses key concerns for Site Reliability Engineers and distributed systems:

- **Proactive Monitoring**: Detecting issues before they affect end users
- **System Resilience**: Enabling rapid response to changing data patterns
- **Observability**: Providing visibility into model behavior in production
- **Scalability**: Handling high-volume data streams through distributed processing
- **Automation**: Reducing manual intervention through automated detection and alerting
