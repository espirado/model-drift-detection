## Data Warehousing Implementation at Sportserve

### Architecture Overview
Sportserve's data warehouse serves as the central repository for all business data, designed specifically to support both historical analysis and real-time decision making.

### 1. Storage Layer - Google BigQuery

**Design Principles:**
- **Partitioned Tables**: Data organized by date for optimal query performance
- **Clustered Fields**: Player ID, game type, and transaction type for fast filtering
- **Nested Structures**: JSON fields for flexible schema evolution
- **Time-Based Architecture**: Separate tables for different data ages

**Table Structure Example:**
```sql
-- Core player events table
CREATE TABLE sportserve_dw.player_events (
  event_id STRING,
  player_id INT64,
  game_id STRING,
  event_type STRING,
  event_data JSON,
  device_info STRUCT<
    type STRING,
    os STRING,
    location STRING
  >,
  timestamp TIMESTAMP
)
PARTITION BY DATE(timestamp)
CLUSTER BY player_id, game_id, event_type;
```

### 2. ETL Pipeline - Apache NiFi

**NiFi Data Flow Architecture:**

**Ingestion Layer:**
```yaml
Data Sources → NiFi Processors:
  - Gaming APIs: ConsumeHTTP → ValidateJSON → RouteOnContent
  - Payment Streams: ConsumeKafka → TransformRecord → PutBigQuery
  - Support Logs: GetFile → ExtractText → ConvertRecord → LoadBigQuery
  - System Metrics: GetHTTP → EvaluateXPath → PutGCPubSub
```

**Transformation Layer:**
```yaml
NiFi Processing Chain:
  Raw Data → Data Quality Check → Schema Validation → 
  Data Enrichment → Format Standardization → Load to BigQuery
```

**Specific NiFi Implementations:**

*Real-time Gaming Events:*
- Capture player actions via game API webhooks
- Validate event schemas against predefined templates
- Enrich with player metadata from cache
- Route to appropriate BigQuery dataset based on event type

*Financial Transaction Processing:*
- Consume payment processor messages
- Apply PCI DSS compliant transformations
- Cross-reference with player accounts
- Load into secured financial data marts

### 3. Data Organization Strategy

**Multi-Layered Approach:**

**Layer 1: Raw Data Landing**
- Exact copies of source data
- Minimal processing, maximum fidelity
- Retention: 7 years for compliance

**Layer 2: Cleansed Data**
- Validated and standardized records
- Enriched with reference data
- Deduplication and error correction

**Layer 3: Data Marts**
- Purpose-built for specific use cases

## Data Mining Integration: The Critical Bridge

### 1. Real-time Feature Engineering

**Connecting Warehouse to Mining:**
Sportserve doesn't wait for traditional batch processing. They've created a real-time bridge:

```python
# Feature engineering pipeline that connects BigQuery to ML
class RealTimeFeatureEngineer:
    def extract_player_features(self, player_id):
        # Live query to BigQuery
        query = f"""
        SELECT 
          player_id,
          COUNT(DISTINCT DATE(timestamp)) as active_days_last_30,
          SUM(bet_amount) as total_bets_last_30,
          AVG(session_duration) as avg_session_duration,
          COUNT(CASE WHEN event_type = 'game_start' THEN 1 END) as games_started
        FROM sportserve_dw.player_events
        WHERE player_id = {player_id}
          AND timestamp >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
        GROUP BY player_id
        """
        return self.bigquery_client.query(query).to_dataframe()
```

### 2. Streaming Analytics Architecture

**How They Bridge Storage and Analysis:**

```
Source Data → NiFi → BigQuery (Storage)
     ↓              ↓
     └─── Cloud Pub/Sub → Dataflow → ML Model → Action
```

**Real-world Implementation:**
- Gaming events stream to both BigQuery (storage) and ML models (analysis)
- Models access historical data from warehouse for context
- Predictions immediately influence game experience

### 3. Machine Learning Model Integration

**A. Fraud Detection Model**
```python
# How warehouse data feeds fraud detection
def detect_fraud_real_time(transaction_data):
    # Get historical patterns from warehouse
    historical_pattern = bigquery.query(f"""
    SELECT AVG(transaction_amount), STDDEV(transaction_amount)
    FROM sportserve_dw.transactions
    WHERE player_id = {transaction_data.player_id}
    AND timestamp >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 90 DAY)
    """)
    
    # Compare with real-time transaction
    if transaction_data.amount > historical_pattern.mean + 3*historical_pattern.stddev:
        return "HIGH_RISK"
    return "NORMAL"
```

**B. Player Recommendation Engine**
```python
# Warehouse-powered recommendations
def generate_recommendations(player_id):
    # Get player's game history from warehouse
    player_games = bigquery.query(f"""
    SELECT game_type, COUNT(*) as play_count, AVG(bet_amount) as avg_bet
    FROM sportserve_dw.player_events
    WHERE player_id = {player_id}
    GROUP BY game_type
    ORDER BY play_count DESC
    """)
    
    # Find similar players from warehouse
    similar_players = bigquery.query(f"""
    SELECT other_player_id, 
           COSINE_SIMILARITY(player_vector, target_player_vector) as similarity
    FROM player_similarity_matrix
    WHERE base_player_id = {player_id}
    ORDER BY similarity DESC
    LIMIT 10
    """)
    
    # Generate recommendations based on warehouse insights
    return ml_model.recommend(player_games, similar_players)
```

### 4. Automated Decision Making

**From Warehouse Data to Real-time Action:**

**Scenario 1: Player Retention**
```
Warehouse Analysis: "Player hasn't logged in for 5 days, typically plays slots"
↓
Data Mining: "Similar players respond well to free spin offers"
↓
Real-time Action: "Send personalized free spins notification"
```

**Scenario 2: Fraud Prevention**
```
Warehouse Context: "Player's typical bet is $10-50, location is UK"
↓
Current Event: "Player attempting $5000 bet from Russia"
↓
Mining Analysis: "99.8% probability of fraud based on historical patterns"
↓
Immediate Action: "Block transaction, freeze account for review"
```

## Technical Bridge Implementation

### 1. Unified Feature Store

Sportserve created a feature store that bridges warehouse and mining:

```python
# Feature store bridging warehouse and ML
class SportserveFeatureStore:
    def __init__(self):
        self.bigquery_client = bigquery.Client()
        self.redis_client = redis.Redis()  # Real-time cache
    
    def get_features(self, player_id, feature_names):
        # Check cache first (bridge to real-time)
        cached_features = self.redis_client.get(f"features:{player_id}")
        
        if not cached_features:
            # Fetch from warehouse
            features = self.bigquery_client.query(f"""
            SELECT {','.join(feature_names)}
            FROM sportserve_dw.player_features
            WHERE player_id = {player_id}
            """).to_dataframe()
            
            # Cache for real-time access
            self.redis_client.setex(
                f"features:{player_id}", 
                300,  # 5 minute TTL
                features.to_json()
            )
            
        return features
```

### 2. Event-Driven Architecture

**Connecting Batch (Warehouse) and Stream (Mining):**

```python
# Event processor that bridges storage and analysis
class EventBridgeProcessor:
    def process_gaming_event(self, event):
        # 1. Store in warehouse (for historical analysis)
        self.save_to_bigquery(event)
        
        # 2. Extract features (bridging data)
        features = self.extract_features(event)
        
        # 3. Run real-time analysis
        prediction = self.ml_model.predict(features)
        
        # 4. Take immediate action if needed
        if prediction.risk_score > 0.8:
            self.trigger_fraud_review(event)
            
        # 5. Update feature store (bridge for future)
        self.update_feature_store(event.player_id, features)
```

### 3. Query Optimization for Mining

**BigQuery Optimizations for ML Workloads:**

```sql
-- Materialized views for frequent ML queries
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW sportserve_dw.ml_player_features AS
SELECT 
  player_id,
  -- Last 30 days aggregations
  SUM(CASE WHEN timestamp >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 30 DAY) 
          THEN bet_amount ELSE 0 END) as bets_30d,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN timestamp >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 30 DAY) 
             THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) as sessions_30d,
  -- Real-time flags
  MAX(timestamp) as last_activity,
  TIMESTAMP_DIFF(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), MAX(timestamp), HOUR) as hours_since_activity
FROM sportserve_dw.player_events
GROUP BY player_id;
```

### 4. Feedback Loop Implementation

**How Mining Results Improve Warehousing:**

```python
# Feedback loop from ML predictions back to warehouse
class MLFeedbackSystem:
    def store_prediction_outcome(self, prediction_id, actual_outcome):
        # Store ML results in warehouse for model improvement
        self.bigquery_client.query(f"""
        INSERT INTO sportserve_dw.ml_predictions
        VALUES (
          '{prediction_id}',
          '{actual_outcome}',
          CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(),
          STRUCT(model_version, confidence_score, features_used)
        )
        """)
        
        # Trigger model retraining if accuracy drops
        accuracy = self.calculate_recent_accuracy()
        if accuracy < 0.8:
            self.trigger_model_retraining()
```

## Real-World Examples of Integration

### Example 1: Dynamic Player Personalization

**The Complete Flow:**
1. **Warehouse Query**: "What games has this player enjoyed historically?"
2. **Real-time Context**: "Player just lost three hands in a row"
3. **Mining Analysis**: "84% chance player will quit if current game continues"
4. **Immediate Action**: "Automatically suggest switch to player's favorite slot game"

**Technical Implementation:**
```python
def handle_losing_streak(player_id, consecutive_losses):
    # Warehouse insight
    favorite_games = bigquery.query(f"""
    SELECT game_id, win_rate
    FROM player_game_preferences
    WHERE player_id = {player_id}
    ORDER BY preference_score DESC
    LIMIT 3
    """)
    
    # Real-time analysis
    quit_probability = churn_model.predict({
        'consecutive_losses': consecutive_losses,
        'current_game_type': current_game,
        'historical_behavior': favorite_games
    })
    
    # Automated intervention
    if quit_probability > 0.8:
        send_game_recommendation(player_id, favorite_games[0])
```

### Example 2: Risk-Based Transaction Processing

**Integration Process:**
1. **Warehouse Context**: Player's 6-month transaction history
2. **Real-time Event**: New withdrawal request
3. **Mining Analysis**: Risk assessment comparing current request to historical patterns
4. **Dynamic Response**: Instant approval, additional verification, or hold for review

**Code Example:**
```python
def process_withdrawal_request(request):
    # Get historical context from warehouse
    player_history = bigquery.query(f"""
    SELECT 
      AVG(amount) as avg_withdrawal,
      STDDEV(amount) as amount_variance,
      COUNT(*) as total_withdrawals,
      MAX(timestamp) as last_withdrawal
    FROM transactions
    WHERE player_id = {request.player_id}
    AND transaction_type = 'WITHDRAWAL'
    AND timestamp >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 180 DAY)
    """)
    
    # Calculate risk score using historical data
    risk_factors = {
        'amount_zscore': (request.amount - player_history.avg_withdrawal) / player_history.amount_variance,
        'time_since_last': hours_between(player_history.last_withdrawal, request.timestamp),
        'frequency_change': compare_recent_frequency(request.player_id)
    }
    
    risk_score = fraud_model.calculate_risk(risk_factors)
    
    # Take action based on integrated analysis
    if risk_score < 0.3:
        return auto_approve(request)
    elif risk_score < 0.7:
        return require_additional_verification(request)
    else:
        return hold_for_manual_review(request)
```

### Example 3: Chatbot Intelligence Integration

**How Warehouse Powers AI Support:**
```python
class IntelligentChatbot:
    def respond_to_player_query(self, player_id, query):
        # Get player context from warehouse
        player_context = bigquery.query(f"""
        SELECT 
          account_status,
          last_transaction_date,
          recent_game_activity,
          support_ticket_history
        FROM comprehensive_player_view
        WHERE player_id = {player_id}
        """)
        
        # Enhanced response using warehouse data
        if "withdrawal" in query.lower():
            if player_context.last_transaction_date > 7:  # days ago
                return f"I see your last transaction was {player_context.last_transaction_date} days ago. Here's your withdrawal status..."
            else:
                # Custom response based on recent activity
                return self.generate_personalized_response(player_context, query)
```
