# Phase 1: System Reliability Drift Detection - A Machine Learning Approach

## Abstract
This research presents a comprehensive methodology for system reliability drift detection using advanced machine learning techniques and log analysis. The study employs the Loghub dataset collection, containing over 100,000 entries with more than 20 engineered features, to develop and validate machine learning models for automated system health monitoring. Our approach combines traditional data mining techniques with modern machine learning algorithms to achieve robust drift detection in complex distributed systems.

  ```

### 3.2 Feature Engineering Justification

#### 3.2.1 Temporal Features
1. **Timestamp Processing**:
   ```python
   def extract_temporal_features(timestamp):
       # Convert to datetime
       dt = datetime.fromtimestamp(timestamp)
       
       # Extract basic features
       hour = dt.hour
       day = dt.weekday()
       
       # Calculate derived features
       is_peak = is_peak_hour(hour)
       time_bucket = get_time_bucket(hour)
       
       return hour, day, is_peak, time_bucket
   ```

   *Rationale*: Temporal features capture system behavior patterns across different time scales.

2. **Session Features**:
   ```python
   def calculate_session_features(events):
       # Group by session
       sessions = group_by_session(events)
       
       # Calculate statistics
       duration = sessions.end_time - sessions.start_time
       event_count = sessions.count()
       event_rate = event_count / duration
       
       return duration, event_count, event_rate
   ```

   *Rationale*: Session-based features help identify user behavior patterns and system usage characteristics.

### 3.3 Data Quality Analysis

    'timestamp': 0.0%,
    'component_id': 0.3%,
    'message': 0.0%,
    'severity': 0.1%,
    'host': 0.2%
}
```

# Numerical feature distributions
distributions = {
    'response_time': 'log-normal',
    'request_size': 'power-law',
    'error_rate': 'exponential',
    'throughput': 'normal'
}
```

     ```

     ```python
     def rf_drift_detector(features):
         rf = RandomForestClassifier(
             n_estimators=100,
             max_depth=None,
             min_samples_split=2
         )
         return rf.fit(features)
     ```

### 4.2 Evaluation Framework

1. **Performance Metrics**:
   ```python
   def calculate_metrics(y_true, y_pred):
       metrics = {
           'accuracy': accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred),
           'precision': precision_score(y_true, y_pred),
           'recall': recall_score(y_true, y_pred),

           'auc_roc': roc_auc_score(y_true, y_pred)
       }
       return metrics
   ```

2. **Validation Strategy**:
   ```python
   def time_series_validation(data, n_splits=5):
       tscv = TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits=n_splits)
       for train_idx, test_idx in tscv.split(data):
           yield data[train_idx], data[test_idx]
