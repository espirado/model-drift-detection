# Model Drift Detection in Streaming AI Systems

A real-time system for detecting and responding to model drift in streaming data environments.

## Project Overview

This project implements a data mining pipeline for detecting distribution shifts in streaming feature data. It leverages Kafka for data streaming and applies statistical methods to identify when model inputs have drifted from their reference distributions.

## Data Mining Methodology

### 1. Data Collection and Understanding
- Collection of streaming data from various sources
- Exploratory analysis of feature distributions
- Identification of data quality issues

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Cleaning and normalization of streaming data
- Handling missing values and outliers
- Standardization of data formats

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Calculation of statistical metrics in sliding windows
- Distribution analysis using statistical methods
- Creation of drift-resistant features

### 4. Drift Detection Algorithms
- Implementation of Jensen-Shannon divergence
- Mean shift detection
- Statistical significance testing
- Adaptive thresholding techniques

### 5. Model Selection and Evaluation
- Comparison of drift detection methods
- Performance metrics for detection accuracy
- Evaluation on synthetic and real-world data

### 6. Results Visualization
- Real-time monitoring of feature distributions
- Drift metric dashboards
- Alert visualization and management

## Technology Stack
